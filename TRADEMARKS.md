# QuantDinger Trademarks & Branding Policy

This document governs the use of **QuantDinger** trademarks and brand assets (including the name, logo, and visual identity).  
It is **separate** from the code license. The code in this repository is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (see `LICENSE`).

> Note: This policy is provided for clarity and is not legal advice.

---

## 1) What is covered

The following are considered **QuantDinger brand assets**:

- The **QuantDinger** name and word marks
- The QuantDinger **logo**, icon, and related images
- Project branding used in the UI/website/marketing materials
- Any confusingly similar marks or visual identity that may imply association

---

## 2) Apache 2.0 vs. trademarks (important)

Apache License 2.0 governs the **code** and allows you to fork, modify, and redistribute the code under its terms.  
However, **Apache 2.0 does not grant trademark rights**. Trademarks are governed by this policy.

You must still comply with Apache 2.0 requirements (e.g., preserving license/copyright notices, and `NOTICE` if present).

---

## 3) Permitted uses (generally allowed)

You may:

- **Accurately refer** to the project as “QuantDinger” when discussing the unmodified project (e.g., tutorials, reviews, bug reports).
- Use the name “QuantDinger” to **link to this repository** or the official community channels.
- Use the logo/name for **non-commercial editorial references** (e.g., blog posts) as long as it does not imply endorsement.

---

## 4) Prohibited uses (not allowed without permission)

You may **not**, without written permission:

- Use QuantDinger trademarks/branding in a way that **suggests endorsement**, sponsorship, affiliation, or official status when it is not true.
- Redistribute a **modified** version of the software while keeping QuantDinger branding in a way that could confuse users about the origin.
- Use QuantDinger branding to market a competing product/service as “official”, “certified”, or “approved” by QuantDinger.
- Register or use confusingly similar names/domains/social accounts that may mislead users.

---

## 5) Forks & redistributions (recommended rules)

If you fork and distribute a modified version:

- **Do not** use “QuantDinger” as the primary product name.
- **Remove/replace** QuantDinger logos and other brand identifiers in the UI and distribution materials, unless you have written permission.
- Keep required Apache 2.0 notices (LICENSE/NOTICE) and do not misrepresent authorship.

If you distribute an **unmodified** build, you may keep QuantDinger branding, but you must not imply that your organization is the official owner unless authorized.

---

## 6) Commercial license, permission & sponsorship

If you need any of the following, please contact us for a **commercial license / written permission**:

- Keeping QuantDinger branding in a redistributed modified version
- Modifying/removing copyright display as agreed
- White-labeling / OEM / enterprise deployments

Commercial licensing can include:

- **Operations support**: deployment, upgrades, incident support, maintenance guidance
- **Consulting services**: architecture review, performance tuning, strategy workflow consulting
